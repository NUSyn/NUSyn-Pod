NUSyn-Pod
=========

Implementation of an iPod manager for UNIX/UNIX-like operating systems using GNUSTEP.

NUSyn-Pod (pronounced 'new-syn-pod') is a Apple iPod manager written using GNUSTEP. Technically,
it *should work with most iPods (read note below).

*Compatibility
From what I read, some of the code and applications I use to implement this software is compatible with most iPods,
but probably incompatible with the more recent iPod Touch and most likely the iPhone. (I am only able to test with my
iPod Touch 2nd Gen, iOS 4.2).
